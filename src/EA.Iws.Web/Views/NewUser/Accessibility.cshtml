            We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:

            <li>some non-text content doesn’t have a textual alternative for use with screen readers</li>

            <li>some input controls are incorrectly coded to assist the user with automated processes</li>
            <li>some content does not have accessible content-to-background colour contrast</li>
            <li>zooming in causes some loss of functionality of certain dropdowns</li>
            <li>some links are not adequately labelled and/or have supporting aria labels for screen readers</li>
            <li>some content header hierarchy is confusing to users</li>
            <li>some controls react and change the context of the page without an explicit action button from the user</li>

            This website is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" target="_blank">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a> version 2.1 AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>some non-text content on the site do not have adequate semantic mark-up and/or ARIA labelling. This means that people using screen readers, other assistive technology or without CSS may not be able to correctly identify features/formatting and may struggle to understand the content as intended. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (Non-text Content) and WCAG 1.3.3 (Sensory Characteristics)</li>
            <li>some tables, form inputs and other features on the site do not have adequate semantic mark-up and/or ARIA labelling. This means that people using screen readers, other assistive technology or without CSS may not be able to correctly identify features/formatting and may struggle to understand the content as intended. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships).</li>
            <li>some form inputs and other features on the site have incorrect autofill attributes. This means that people using auto complete data to correctly populate screens, may struggle to understand the content as intended. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.5 (Identify input purpose).</li>
            <li>some features and components do not feature a high enough colour contrast of a minimum of 3:1. This means that some users with visual impairments may struggle to distinguish and use features or components. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.3 (Contrast (Minimum)).</li>
            <li>some pages when zoomed into 400% display content (to simulate a mobile device) incorrectly and causes the screen to scroll in multiple axes. This means that some users with visual impairments are unable to resize text to read comfortably. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.10 (Reflow).</li>
            <li>some pages do not have a working mechanism to adequately bypass blocks of content that are repeated. This means that keyboard users cannot effectively skip to unique content on some pages. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.1 (Bypass blocks)</li>
            <li>some pages feature links that do not have adequate descriptors or context. This means that users using assistive technology, such as screen readers, may be unable to identify the function or destination of the link easily. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.4 (Link purpose (in context)).</li>
            <li>some pages have content with headings or labels that are incorrectly used, missing or without the appropriate attribute. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.6 (Headings and labels).</li>
            <li>when using a screen reader, some are unable to identify that some auto complete dropdown components are present and functional meaning that there could be an automated input that the user isn’t aware of. This means that users using assistive technology may not be able to use the service as intended. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 3.2.2 (On input).</li>
            <li>some error summaries are missing the appropriate ‘alert’ ARIA role which prevents screen readers from automatically reading out the error summaries. This means that users using screen readers may become confused as the errors are not automatically read out loud to them. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 3.3.1 (Error identification).</li>
            <li>some pages have content with missing labels or instructions. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 3.3.2 (Labels and instructions).</li>
            <li>some error summaries are generic and do not suggest a known correction that is appropriate. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 3.3.3 (Error suggestion).</li>
            <li>some pages have content that do not have the appropriate programmatical state or property. This means that assistive technologies do not work properly for examples like name and role. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2 (Name, role, value).</li>
